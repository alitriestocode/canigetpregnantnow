#This is the backend Python file for Can I Get Pregnant Now?

#Logic
#Python will receive the date of the first day of the last period
#Python will receive the average length of cycle
#Program will work out ovulation stage of cycle
    #take date format and change to integer
    #half the average length of cycle
    #add to the first day of the last period
    #push out first day (and following 5-10 days) as ovulation stage
    #convert back to date
